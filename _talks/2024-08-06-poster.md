Some high-z active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are found to reside in extreme star-forming galaxies, such as hyper-luminous infrared galaxies (HyLIRGs), with AGN-removed LIR of > 1013 L⊙. In this paper, we report NOEMA observations of six apparent starburst HyLIRGs associated with optical quasars at z ∼ 2 − 3 in the Stripe 82 field, to study their dust and molecular CO properties. Five out of the six candidates are detected with CO(4-3) or CO(5-4) emission, and four in 2mm dust continuum. Based on the linewidth-L′CO(1−0) diagnostics, we find that four galaxies are likely unlensed or weakly lensed sources. The molecular gas mass is in the range of μMH2 ∼ 0.8 − 9.7 × 1010 M⊙ (withα = 0.8 M⊙ (K km s−1 pc2)−1 and μ is the unknown possible gravitational magnification factor). We fit their SEDs, after including the observed 2mm fluxes and upper limits, and estimate their apparent (uncorrected for possible lensing effect) star formation rates (μSFRs) to be ∼ 400 − 2500 M⊙ yr−1with depletion time of ∼ 20 − 110 Myr. We notice interesting offsets, of ∼ 10 − 40 kpc spatially or∼ 1000 − 2000 km s−1 spectroscopically, between the optical quasar and the mm continuum or CO emissions. The observed velocity shift is likely related to the blueshifted broad-emission-line region of quasars, though mergers or recoiling black holes are also possible causes, which can explain the spatial offset and the high intrinsic SFRs in the HyLIRG-quasar systems.
