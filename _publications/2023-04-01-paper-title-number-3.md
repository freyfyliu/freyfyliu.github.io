Dust-rich broad-emission-line qusars (DBQs) are in a critical phase in galaxy
evolution, whose star-forming potential can be revealed by the molecular gas. We used
the IRAM-30m telescope to observe CO emission lines in nine DBQs at 0.5 < z < 3, and
detected nine lines at different transitions in eight sources. Five lines are strong detections,
and four lines are tentative detections. According to the CO line-width versus line luminosity
diagram, seven sources satisfy the unlensed/slightly-lensed relation, while one is likely to be
strongly lensed by a factor of about 12. With lensing-corrected infrared luminosities from
the literature and SED fitting, we estimate their star formation rates to be approximately
40 ∼ 3,500 M⊙·yr−1, and the gas depletion time to be approximately 20 ∼ 300 Myr. Their star
formation efficiency shows no significant difference from other SMGs and QSOs comparing
their IR and CO luminosities. We find a negative correlation between AGN relative strength
and gas depletion time, which is consistent with the QSO evolutionary model
