Life is busy, but even a PhD student can have hobbies. I like bouldering and playing table tennis with friends in my spare time.

I enjoy taking pictures of mostly nature (while hiking) and sometimes people.

I like various genres of music. I was the president of Linquan (林泉, "forest-spring") Piano Society at Nanjing University 2017-2018.
