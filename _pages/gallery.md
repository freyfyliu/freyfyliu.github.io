Life is busy, but even a PhD student can have hobbies. I like running, hiking, bouldering and playing table tennis with friends in my spare time.

I enjoy taking pictures of mostly nature and sometimes people. I worked part-time in wild animal protection charities [Eco-Bridge Continental](https://eco-bridgecontinental.org.cn/), [Let Birds Fly](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E8%AE%A9%E5%80%99%E9%B8%9F%E9%A3%9E/2394992) and [Shan Shui](http://en.shanshui.org/) when I was in China. I am actively looking for opportunities to participate in conservation in Scotland, through either photography (e.g., [Wiki Scotland Competition](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Wiki_Loves_Earth_2024_in_Scotland)) or data analysis.

I like various genres of music, from rock to classical. My interested instruments include piano, guitar and harmonica. I was the president of Linquan (林泉, "forest-spring") Piano Society at Nanjing University 2017-2018.
