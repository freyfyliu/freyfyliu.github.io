Life as a PhD student is busy but still manageable for hobbies. I normally hike, boulder and play table tennis with friends after work.

Photography connects me with both nature (always) and people (sometimes). I volunteered as a recorder and data analyst for wild animal protection charities [Eco-Bridge Continental](https://eco-bridgecontinental.org.cn/), [Let Birds Fly](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E8%AE%A9%E5%80%99%E9%B8%9F%E9%A3%9E/2394992) and [Shan Shui](http://en.shanshui.org/) when I was in China. I am actively looking for opportunities to participate in conservation in Scotland, through either photography (e.g., [Wiki Loves Earth](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Wiki_Loves_Earth_2024_in_Scotland)) or data analysis.

I like various genres of music, from rock to classical. My interested instruments include piano, guitar and harmonica. I was the president of Linquan (林泉, "forest-spring") Piano Society at Nanjing University in 2017-2018.

I love traveling and my occupation gives me the advantage to visit telescope sites. Can't wait to have more photos for this section!
