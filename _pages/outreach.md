Writing and translating

I am an active science writer and translator, focusing on advances in astronomy and my experiences as an astronomy researcher. I have published approximately 100 articles in some of China's most influential media, including:

National Astronomy of China (中国国家天文), Guangming Daily (光明日报), Science World (科学世界), New Educator (新教育家), Tonight News (今晚报), Guokr (果壳网), Duzhe (读者), Youth Literary Digest (青年文摘), etc.

I translate popular science books from other languages to Chinese, including:

Others
-----
I am also interested in presenting astronomy concepts in art forms and always ready for collaboration.
I helped curate Cosmic Elements (步天歌) in 2023, one of the largest astronomy-themed contemporary art exhibitions in China. 
It has toured to many major cities in China, including Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Chengdu.

I am also a science influencer on Chinese social platforms Douban (豆瓣) and RedNote (小红书). 18K followers by March 2025.
