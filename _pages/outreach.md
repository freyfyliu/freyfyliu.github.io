Others

I am particularly interested in presenting astronomy concepts in art forms and always ready for collaboration.
I helped curate Cosmic Elements (步天歌) in 2023, one of the largest astronomy-themed contemporary art exhibitions in China. 
It has toured to many major cities in China, including Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Chengdu.

I am also a science communicator on Chinese social platform Douban (豆瓣). More than 13K followers and 5M reads by July 2024.
