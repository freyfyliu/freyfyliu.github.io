Writing and translating
----
I am an active science writer and translator. My writing is about not only advances in astronomy, but also my life as an astronomy researcher. I have published articles in some of the most influential medias in China, including:

National Astronomy of China (中国国家天文), Guangming Daily (光明日报), Science World (科学世界), New Educator (新教育家), Tonight News (今晚报), Guokr (果壳网), Duzhe (读者), Youth Literary Digest (青年文摘), etc.

I have translated several English popular science books to Chinese:

(2) **[Supernova](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262543149/supernova/) (MIT Press, 2022)** Chinese version 超新星 published by Canton Huacheng Press (广东花城出版社), expected in 2024.

(1) **[Is Einstein still right?](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/is-einstein-still-right-9780198842125?cc=gb&lang=en&) (Oxford Press, 2020)** Chinese version 爱因斯坦还是对的吗 published by Hunan Science and Technology Press (湖南科技出版社) in 2023.

I am also a science influencer on Chinese social platform Douban (豆瓣). More than 13K followers and 5M reads by July 2024.

Others

I am particularly interested in presenting astronomy concepts in art forms and always ready for collaboration.
I helped curate Cosmic Elements (步天歌) in 2023, one of the largest astronomy-themed contemporary art exhibitions in China. 
It has toured to many major cities in China, including Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Chengdu.
