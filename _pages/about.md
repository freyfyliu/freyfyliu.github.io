I am Feng-Yuan Liu (given name: 丰源, /Fahng-Yooan/; surname: 刘, /Lyeu/), a Ph.D. student in Astronomy and Mary Brück Scholar at the Institute for Astronomy, University of Edinburgh, Royal Observatory of Edinburgh. I am currently working under the supervision of Prof. James Dunlop, Prof. Ross McLure, and Dr. Derek McLeod. My research interests lie in galaxy evolution in the high-redshift universe (see <i>[Research](https://freyfyliu.github.io/research/)<i> for details).

I hold an M.Sc. degree in Astrophysics from the National Astronomical Observatory of China (NAOC) and a B.Sc. degree in Astronomy from Nanjing University (NJU).

Fun fact about me: My Chinese first name means "abundant sources" -- not bad for an observer! I also go by Frey in daily life.
