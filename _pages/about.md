I am a PhD student in Astronomy at the [Institute for Astronomy](https://ifa.roe.ac.uk/), [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/), [Royal Observatory of Edinburgh](https://www.roe.ac.uk/).
My PhD study is under the supervision of Prof. [James Dunlop](https://www.roe.ac.uk/~jsd/), Prof. [Ross McLure](https://www.roe.ac.uk/~rjm/Ross_McLures_Webpage/Welcome.html), and Dr. [Derek McLeod](https://www.roe.ac.uk/ifa/people/mcleod.html) and funded by the [Mary Br√ºck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Br%C3%BCck) scholarship.
Before PhD study, I obtained Master in Astrophysics from the National Astronomical Observatory of China ([NAOC](https://english.nao.cas.cn/)) and Bachelor in Astronomy from Nanjing University ([NJU](https://astronomy.nju.edu.cn/EN/index.html)).

Research interests
======
My current research focuses on multi-wavelength observations of star-forming galaxies and active galactic nuclei at different epochs of the Universe.
Specifically, I am working on the following two topics.

Dust-obscured star formation in the young Universe revealed by combining JWST PRIMER and ALMA
------
A significant fraction of star formation over cosmic history is obscured by dust, which absorbs UV light and re-emits at far-infrared/millimeter wavelengths. 
However, completing our census of cosmic star formation, combining the unobscured (UV/optical) and obscured (far-infrared/mm) star-forming galaxy populations has proved challenging due to the difficulties of combining datasets at very different wavelengths (and often different resolutions). 
Indeed, many dusty sources detected at (sub-)mm wavelengths have proved difficult to detect at short wavelengths, even with Hubble.  
However, the additional depth and near-infrared wavelength coverage delivered by JWST is now transforming this field. 
Aided by the excellent astrometric accuracy delivered by both JWST and ALMA,  we use the (now complete) JWST PRIMER NIRCam+MIRI imaging in the COSMOS PRIMER field  to identify the galaxy counterparts to 99% of the known mm-wavelength sources in the field, as revealed by the ALMA A3COSMOS database. 
Never before has such a large and deep mm-wavelength sample been essentially completely and robustly identified at rest-frame optical wavelengths, and we use detailed spectral evolution fitting to determine the redshift distribution and physical properties (star-formation rates, ages, stellar masses) of the dust-enshrouded population. 
Moreover, the mm depth and optical ID completeness of our sample enables us to set new constraints on the contribution of dust-enshrouded galaxies to the rise of star-formation density at early times.

Evolutionary status of starburst dusty unobscured quasars 
------
Quasars are the most powerful stage in supermassive black hole evolution, and their feedback usually causes reduction of star formation and dust content in the host galaxies.
However, there are some optical-unobscured quasars that exhibit far-infrared excess, suggesting starburst and massive dust in their host galaxies.
This population challenges current understanding of quasar evolution model. 
We have used single-dish mm telescope IRMA-30m and interferometer NOEMA to observe molecular gas in these systems and confirmed they are unlensed and in a short transitional phase.
Further study requires more state-of-the-art facilities to resolve them spatially and spectroscopically, such as ALMA and VLT.
